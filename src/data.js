The locals pronounce G as J so noone knew how to pronounce my name properly. During my free time, i code alot, read alot & volunteer as much as time allows. I volunteer mainly with kids with cancer as well as dogs & cats. I am currently working as a Product Manager in a start-up & it made me realise the power of technology."

        info: "I've recently got my hands onto coding. It's so fun & addictive and I'm completely hooked onto it. I would like to join this bootcamp so as to learn more about front-end and backend development. This can guide me towards a career switch as well as using technology to help the less fortunate especially so for the causes that I believe in. One of the projects that I would really love to work on is creating a online tuition resource platform for cancer kids to catch up on their studies when they cant attend school."
